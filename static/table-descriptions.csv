PlatformData,analytics,"In this table we capture how many reports, resources, comments, resource_votes, comment_votes, single, partial or full ratings and chat messages each user makes for a specific problem in a specific group in one handy analytics file. We also calculate an engagement level. Engagement is measured by assigning 7 points for a report, 4 points for a resource, 3 points for a complete rating, 2 points for a comment, on point for a chat message, a single or partial rating or a comment vote."
PlatformData,authors,"Responses (i.e. reports or ""resources"") can have multiple authors.  This table captures the authors of responses."
PlatformData,chat,Users can chat freely within each problem.  The following table captures the chat data.
PlatformData,comments,Users can comment on responses.  The following table captures these comments.
PlatformData,login,"We capture when users log in and out of the platform. A few caveats here: Since many users do not expressly logout but rather just close the browser window we can track far less logouts than logins (rougly a third). We have not attempted to estimate how long a user stays on platform. Also, we do not track which problem a user is looking at. This data can only be supplied on platform level. It includes all login/logouts to this environment, not scaled down to specific tests or exercises.  "
PlatformData,problems,The problems table uniquely identifies and describes the problem that SWARM users were working on.
PlatformData,ratings,"Users can rate the responses and comments of other users.  The following table captures these ratings.  Note that users can rate as many times as they like (each of which is captured in the table), but only the last ratings are used in calculating the aggregate rating.  In other words, the ""rating_total"" with the latest timestamp in the *Ratings* table should match the ""team_rating"" in the *TopReport* table."
PlatformData,relations,"A table collecting interaction between users. As an interaction counts if a user commented on another users' response, if a user is named as a contributor for a report or if a user mentions another user in the chat. The interactions are stored summed up per problem and per action."
PlatformData,top_reports,"Top Reports are the reports that have the highest quality (readiness) rating at the time of the data dump. Of particular interest are ""final reports"" at the end of a test, but it is possible that an interim data dump is made, in which case the top report is the highest rated report at the time of the data set. Internally, it is also possible that such reports are identifiable through other data in the SWARM platform (such as a report submission event log), but only the basic information is captured in the table below."
PlatformData,responses,"Responses are text contributed by users in response to the problem.  Currently, responses can be ""reports"" or ""resources"", but more types are possible in future."
PlatformData,timeline,"Another handy table that stores actions on the platform. Collects timestamps for all resources and reports posted on the platform, timestamps for all comments made on the platform including on which report/resource, timestamp for ratings made including on which report and updates made to resources and reports. Caveat: updates are stored as single edits and have to be mangled to become useful (e.g. only count edits made at least 5 minutes apart as an actual update)."
CoreData,parts,One row per participant who was registered for this platform instance. Most of the columns in this table contain responses to questions on the entry and exit surveys.
CoreData,teamparts,"One row per team-participant pairing. Useful for pairing participants with teams. Participants can be members of multiple teams over the course of an experiment. For example, a user may be a member of a generic public team in the beginning, and then be selected for a super team later on."
CoreData,teams,"One row per team in the competition, with related attributes."
CoreData,probteams,"One row per team-problem pairing (instance of a team attempting a problem), with related attributes."
CoreData,rates,"One row per external rating, with related attributes. Contains raw quality of reasoning scores and other ratings such as on the redaction test for tightness."
CoreData,probparts,"One row per participant-problem pairing (instance of a participant being a member of a team attempting a particular problem), with related attributes."

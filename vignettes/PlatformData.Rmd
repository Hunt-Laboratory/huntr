## Introduction

This document describes a set of datatables that provide a basic, relatively complete dataset of a SWARM test.  The idea is that most quantitative and qualitative analysis of user interaction with SWARM and its outcomes is captured with these tables. The data tables are structured in (mostly) normalised relational form, so that it is easy to process with most analytical tools.  The only data that is missing is the very finegrained on-platform behaviour by users such as click patterns, including edits made to content (only the final text is captured here).

The remainder of this document is a list of data tables, each of which captures key elements of the overall data that is captured when SWARM is used in a test or experiment. Note: only data that is generated on the SWARM platform is included here.  Other data, like surveys is not included.

All tables are to be stored in a file folder with the following naming convention:  SWARM-UniqueTestName-YYYY-MM-DD

The folder has subfolders for each major component of the data model: authors, chat, comments, media, problems, ratings, reports and responses.

In the subfolders, tables are provided in CSV format, where each row is a record of data, with columns for fields. If a column contains free-form text, then the content is delimited with double-quotes (note that use of double quotes inside a text field needs to be 'escaped' with paired double quotes).  Where the data includes "rich text" content, there will be a file reference field in the table, which points to a unique filename in a subfolder.  For example, the "problem" table may contain a field called "problem_file", where the value in that field may be "319e76a.html", which refers to a file in the html subfolder. The file itself may contain further links to other files (e.g. images), which may be stored in further subfolders, if the HTML file is not self-contained.

Note-1: "Unique identifier" means unique to an instance of the SWARM platform unless otherwise specified.  The identifiers may be unique more broadly (e.g. uuid) but the minimum level is unique within the instance of SWARM.

Note-2: Timestamps are in UTC with a format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS


## The problem

The problem table uniquely identifies and describes the problem that SWARM users were working on.

Table File Name:    Problem.csv

ColumnName          Description
--------------      ----------------------------------------
problem_id           Unique identifier of the problem
problem              Short title of the problem
problem_text         A unique filename of the problem content in markdown text format
problem_file         A unique filename in the "Problems" subfolder that contains the HTML file of the problem


## Top Reports

Top Reports are the reports that have the highest quality (readiness) rating at the time of the data dump. Of particular interest are "final reports" at the end of a test, but it is possible that an interim data dump is made, in which case the top report is the highest rated report at the time of the data set. Internally, it is also possible that such reports are identifiable through other data in the SWARM platform (such as a report submission event log), but only the basic information is captured in the table below.

Table File Name:    top_reports.csv

ColumnName          Description
--------------      --------------------------------------------------------
problem_id           Unique identifier of the problem

## Responses

Responses are text contributed by users in response to the problem.  Currently, responses can be "reports" or "resources", but more types are possible in future.

## Ratings

Users can rate the responses and comments of other users.  The following table captures these ratings.  Note that users can rate as many times as they like (each of which is captured in the table), but only the last ratings are used in calculating the aggregate rating.  In other words, the "rating_total" with the latest timestamp in the *Ratings* table should match the "team_rating" in the *TopReport* table.

chat_text            The comment content in plain text format


## Login

We capture when users log in and out of the platform. A few caveats here: Since many users do not expressly logout but rather just close the browser window we can track far less logouts than logins (rougly a third). We have not attempted to estimate how long a user stays on platform. Also, we do not track which problem a user is looking at. This data can only be supplied on platform level. It includes all login/logouts to this environment, not scaled down to specific tests or exercises.  

ColumnName          Description
---------------         -----------------------------------------------------------
user_id                 Unique identifier of the user who logs in/out
user_name               Name of user who logs in/out
event                   Can either be login or logout
time_stamp              Timestamp when login/logout occurred 


## Analytics

In this file we capture how many reports, resources, comments, resource_votes, comment_votes, single, partial or full ratings and chat messages each user makes for a specific problem in a specific group in one handy analytics file. We also calculate an engagement level. Engagement is measured by assigning 7 points for a report, 4 points for a resource, 3 points for a complete rating, 2 points for a comment, on point for a chat message, a single or partial rating or a comment vote.


ColumnName                  Description

engagement_normed           Calculated number of overall engagement of one user to a problem, using normed engagement scores as inputs


## Relations

A file collecting interaction between users. As an interaction counts if a user commented on another users' response, if a user is named as a contributor for a report or if a user mentions another user in the chat. The interactions are stored summed up per problem and per action.

ColumnName          Description
---------------         -----------------------------------------------------------
addressant              User addressed by the other user (e.g. mentioned in chat)
problem_id              Unique identifier of problem
team_name               Name of team both users are in
user_name               User who addresses another user ( e.g. writes a chat message that contains a name tag)
problem                 Name of problem 
interaction             Describes the interaction: 'comment', 'contributor' or 'chat'
count                   Number of times this interaction happened


## Timeline

Another handy file that stores actions on the platform. Collects timestamps for all resources and reports posted on the platform, timestamps for all comments made on the platform including on which report/resource, timestamp for ratings made including on which report and updates made to resources and reports. Caveat: updates are stored as single edits and have to be mangled to become useful (e.g. only count edits made at least 5 minutes apart as an actual update).

ColumnName          Description
---------------         -----------------------------------------------------------
chunk_id                Unique identifier for the artefact contributed (can be a report, resource, comment, rating, update)
parent_id               Unique identifier for the source the artefact was contributed to (a report or resource in case of a comment or update, a problem_id in case of a report or resource, a report in case of a rating)
problem_id              Unique identifier for the problem (e.g. in case the artefact is a report or resource parent and problem id are identical)
team_id                 Unique identifier for team
team_name               Name of team
timestamp               Timestamp when artefact was contributed, for resources, reports and comments this is their first post, for ratings only the last update is stored
type                    The artefact type, can be report, resource, comment, rating, update
problem                 The problem title
user_id                 Unique indentifier of the user contributing the artefact
user_name               Name of user
